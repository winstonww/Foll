		<h1> About Foll </h1>

		So your friend/family has invited you to a party. Great. What food should I bring this time?  Should I bring the spaghetti? They probably had enough of it... How about some wine? Too Expensive. Jeez, if only there's app that make the decision for me....

		 Look no further! With Foll, Choosing what food to bring can never be so easy. Foll is the app that helps you decide what food to bring to a potluck. Given a cost constraint specified by the user, the app will determine a list of suggested items from attendees that will maximize the value. The total amount spend of the food, of course, will be evenly split among all those attended the party. 

		 The app is created by Winston Wong (NÎ¨ 1T8) from the University of Toronto.
