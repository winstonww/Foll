			<h1> About FOLL </h1>
			<br>
			<p>So your friend invited you to a party. 

			"Great. Should I bring the spaghetti again? They probably had enough of it... How about some wine? Too Expensive. Jeez, if only there's an app to make the decision for you..."</p>

			<p> Look no further! With Foll, choosing what food to bring can never be so easy. Foll is the app that helps you decide what food to bring to a potluck. Given a cost constraint specified by the user, the app will determine a list of suggested items from attendees that will maximize the value. The total amount spend of the food, of course, will be evenly split among all those attended the party. </p>

			<p> To find out more about how to use this app, check out the the Help Section.</p>

			<p> The app is created by Winston Wong (NÎ¨ 1T8) from the University of Toronto. </p>
