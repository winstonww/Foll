			<h1> About FOLL </h1>

			<p>So your friend has invited you to a party. Great. What food should I bring this time?  Should I bring the spaghetti? They probably had enough of it... How about some wine? Too Expensive. Jeez, if only there's app that make the decision for me....</p>

			<p> Look no further! With Foll, choosing what food to bring can never be so easy. Foll is the app that helps you decide what food to bring to a potluck. Given a cost constraint specified by the user, the app will determine a list of suggested items from attendees that will maximize the value. The total amount spend of the food, of course, will be evenly split among all those attended the party. </p>

			<p> To find out more about how to use this app, check out the the Help Section.</p>

			<p> The app is created by Winston Wong (NÎ¨ 1T8) from the University of Toronto. </p>
